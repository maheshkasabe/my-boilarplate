              <h2 className="text-2xl font-aharoni text-gray-900 dark:text-white mt-8 mb-4">Purpose of ESG Policy</h2>
              <p className="mb-4">
                This policy applies to Diligent Insight Ltd (and its employees, contractors, and partners). This ESG Policy outlines our commitment to operating in an ethical, transparent, and sustainable way. This has been driven by our CEO, who has proven credentials in the environmental field, having been a non-executive director and trustee of Scotland's largest environmental charity for seven years. While we are an early-stage technology company, we recognise that strong ESG practices are essential to long-term success, building trust with stakeholders, and minimising our impact on people and the planet.
